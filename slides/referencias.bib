    ABSTRACT = {Persistent homology is a powerful tool in topological data analysis (TDA) to compute, study, and encode efficiently multi-scale topological features and is being increasingly used in digital image classification. The topological features represent a number of connected components, cycles, and voids that describe the shape of data. Persistent homology extracts the birth and death of these topological features through a filtration process. The lifespan of these features can be represented using persistent diagrams (topological signatures). Cubical homology is a more efficient method for extracting topological features from a 2D image and uses a collection of cubes to compute the homology, which fits the digital image structure of grids. In this research, we propose a cubical homology-based algorithm for extracting topological features from 2D images to generate their topological signatures. Additionally, we propose a novel score measure, which measures the significance of each of the sub-simplices in terms of persistence. In addition, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and contrast limited adapting histogram equalization (CLAHE) are used as supplementary methods for extracting features. Supervised machine learning models are trained on selected image datasets to study the efficacy of the extracted topological features. Among the eight tested models with six published image datasets of varying pixel sizes, classes, and distributions, our experiments demonstrate that cubical homology-based machine learning with the deep residual network (ResNet 1D) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (lightGBM) shows promise with the extracted topological features.},
