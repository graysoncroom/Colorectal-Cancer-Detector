# Colorectal-Cancer-Detector
Determines if a given Colorectal tissue image is cancerous or healthy using methods from Topology for the input embedding (TDA).

I developed this project while taking MATH 4V91.001 - Undergraduate Topics in Mathematics (Topological Data Analysis) under Dr. Baris Coskunuzer at The University of Texas at Dallas.

This was a special topics course where each student was given a semester-long ML project. The lectures were an informal introduction to Topological methods.

You can find the presentation I gave on my findings [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/prwscnsxnwrx), but the rendered pdf I used on the day of the presentation can be found in the *slides* directory.

If you'd like to learn more about this project please take a look at the above presentation.
